# watchware apps for your smartwatch 
### From SMART-PHONE to Dumb-PHONE with SMART-watch. 

# Q&A - tl;dr
**What?** - Apps for your Android based Smartwatch like Galaxy-/Pixel-/Xiaomi-Watch (Maybe Huawei).
**Why?** - Use your watch more for whats important and your phone less for what in the end is just stealing time.
**How?** - Download -> Install -> Use -> Donate back a part of the value you received.
**Where?** - On Github and not on app stores - freedom for you and me. Making app stores happy takes time and hence takes away from creating value.
**Motivation?** - Fill the obvious need of standalone apps for watches and therefore working on something of interest and value the way i like and brings best value.
**The code is bad?** - If it provides value and does not harm security, privacy etc., then it does what it is supposed to. All value driven.
**What might people hate?** - You might hate that i only invest time and energy where i like or where those like, that support by donations.
**Where do donations go?** - Donations will cover my costs on all levels. The more donations i get, the more i can work on these projects.
**Something missing?** - Alot! Of course! - just getting started
