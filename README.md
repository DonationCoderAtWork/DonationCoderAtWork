# watchware by DonationCoderAtWork - Apps for your Android based Smartwatch
### Moving from smartphone to smartwatch

**What?** - A growing collection of practical, standalone apps built specifically for Android-based smartwatches like Galaxy Watch, Pixel Watch, Xiaomi Watch — and possibly Huawei.\
**Why?** - Use your watch more for whats important and your phone less for what in the end is just stealing time.\
**How?** - Download -> Install -> Use -> Donate back a part of the value you received.\
**Where?** - I choose to release on GitHub for flexibility, freedom, and faster iteration. App store submissions take time and limit what I can build for the people who care.\
**Motivation?** - To fill the clear gap in smartwatch-first apps — designed for utility, focus, and simplicity. I build what matters to me and to the supporters who make this work possible.\
**Code Quality?** - The apps are functional, privacy-respecting, and intentionally lightweight. If it works, adds value, and protects users, it meets the mark — even if the code isn’t perfect.\
**Priorities?** - I focus my time and energy where it’s appreciated: on features, ideas, and feedback from users who sponsor or contribute. This keeps development joyful and sustainable.\
**Where do donations go?** - Your support directly funds development time and tools. The more support I receive, the more energy I can put into improving these apps and creating new ones.\
**Something missing?** - Alot! Of course! - just getting started\
